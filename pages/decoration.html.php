<h1>I'm decorated by Pages</h1>
<p>What does it mean?</p>
<p>Simply that there is a native menu having blabla as Alias... and by adding a file called blabla.html.php I can add my own content to the native component content.</p>
<p>And now starts original's component view:</p>
<ktml:content> 
<p>PS: oh, btw, this line is also added by Pages after the original content.</p>
